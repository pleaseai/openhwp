# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers how to get from a clone to a merged pull request.

By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All documentation, code, comments, and commit messages in this repository are written in **English**.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pleaseai/openhwp.git
cd openhwp
deno install        # cache dependencies (once deno.json lands)
```

OpenHWP runs on a single **Deno** toolchain (no Node, bun, or mise). You need
[Deno](https://deno.com) **≥ 2.9.0** (`deno desktop` was introduced in 2.9);
check with `deno --version`. See the [README](./README.en.md) for the full stack.

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch from `main` (e.g. `feat/short-description` or `fix/issue-123`).
2. Make focused changes — keep each pull request to one logical change.
3. Run the checks below and make sure they pass.
4. Open a pull request and fill out the template.

```bash
deno lint           # lint
deno fmt --check    # formatting
deno test           # run the test suite
```

> **Note:** application code is not in the repository yet. The app-level tasks
> (`deno task dev`, the desktop build) land with the implementation; until then
> these built-in Deno checks are the baseline.

## Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): subject`, where `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc. Breaking changes include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Versioning and the changelog are generated automatically from these messages, so accurate types matter.

## Pull requests

External contributions start with an issue or a discussion, not a PR. If a
maintainer decides to take your bug or feature forward, they open an approval
PR from that thread. Once the approval PR merges, your pull requests stay open
and go through normal review. Until then, PRs from outside the team are closed
automatically and pointed back to this process.

A drive-by AI-generated PR is cheap to write and expensive to review. Deciding
what to build, and how, is the part we'd rather do with you up front.

Once you are approved (or a member of the team):

- Reference the issue your PR addresses (e.g. `Closes #123`).
- Use a Conventional-Commit-style PR title — it becomes the squash-merge commit.
- Make sure CI is green before requesting review.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

| You want to…                     | File it as…      | Humans                                                                              | Agents                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Report a bug or propose a fix    | an **Issue**     | [New issue](https://github.com/pleaseai/openhwp/issues/new/choose)                  | [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)                              |
| Request a feature or enhancement | a **Discussion** | [New discussion](https://github.com/pleaseai/openhwp/discussions/categories/ideas)  | [`.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/ideas.yml`](.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/ideas.yml) |

A well-framed problem is worth more to us than a finished PR. Send the clearest
account of the bug, or the strongest case for the feature — the full context
that lets us guide the work. Accepted proposals are promoted to issues before
implementation, and if we take yours on, we credit you.
